# typescript-tictactoe

This is TicTacToe written in TypeScript. I ported the code from my previous [Python implementation](https://github.com/mevdschee/python-tictactoe).

### Motivation

I tried to make a small starter project for your/my own games. By cloning this starter you should be able to create more complex games. Check out AceCardGames.com to get an idea of what you could be building and clone my small starter project and get creative with your own ideas and designs.
